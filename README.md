# Northcoders News API

Here is a link to the hosted version of Northcoders News API: [NC_news](https://nc-news-nbi4.onrender.com) 
 - Please enter `/api` as your first endpoint. This provides a list of all available endpoints within this API.

## Overview
Welcome to my API project ðŸ‘‹. My goal is to build a backend service using Node.js and PostgreSQL which provides access to application data programmatically. Much like real-world backend services such as **Reddit**, my API will serve as the bridge between the front-end architecture and the underlying data storage. 

## What Does My API Do?  
My API encompasses various types of data essential for application functionality, including users, comments, articles, and topics. With endpoints designed for GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE operations, developers can interact with these data entities efficiently and securely.

## Installation and Setup 
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash 
git clone https://github.com/Danilo-Piga/nc-news
```

2. Create .env files:

Create two .env files in the root folder of the project, then add your **environment variables** to those files. 

### example

Test environment:
- .env.test - `PGDATABASE=data_base_test`

Development environment:
- .env.development - `PGDATABASE=data_base_development`

> Find the required database names in **setup.sql** located here > `/db/setup.sql`

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
4. Setup database
```bash
npm run setup-dbs
```
5. Seed the local database:
```bash
npm run seed
```

6. Run tests:
```bash
npm test app.test.js   
```
